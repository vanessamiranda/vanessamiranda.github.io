I'm Vanessa, a +9 years experienced eCommerce specialist and +4 years expert in the data analytics domain. Turning data into insights and turning insights into value, has always been my mission. I am skilled in most data-science steps: data pre-processing, application of statistical methods, data visualization and results communication. I am currently pursing my Statistics and Data Science MicroMasters Program with Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

Have fun browsing through my data science portfolio and thanks for visiting!
