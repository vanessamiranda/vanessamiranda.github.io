I'm Vanessa, a +9 years experienced digital marketing / eCommerce specialist with +4 years proven track record in the data analytics domain. Turning data into insights and, turning insights into value; has always been my passion. 

I am skilled in key data-science steps: data pre-processing, application of statistical modeling, data visualization and results communication. 

I've completed [LEAD's Data Science 360 program](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vampVS6D48Lu1LdUm8_HOpgf3swUv8N-/view) and [IBM's Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/95MKH4XSL2XA), a 9 specialisation course. I am currently pursing my MicroMasters in *Statistics and Data Science*, a credential program with Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

Have fun browsing through my data science portfolio and thanks for visiting!
