Absenteeism is an employee's intentional or habitual absence from work. While employers expect employees to miss a certain number of workdays each year, excessive absences can equate to decreased productivity and can have a major effect on company finances, morale, and other factors.

In this project is to help predict Absenteeism at Company X during work time. The project is broken up into 2 phases:

* Phase 1: [Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Analysis](https://vanessamiranda.github.io/_pages/2019-08-21-Predicting_Absenteeism_Productivity.html)
