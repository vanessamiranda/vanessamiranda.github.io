While employers expect employees to miss a certain number of workdays each year, excessive absences can equate to decreased productivity and can have a major effect on company finances, morale, and other factors.

In this project is to help predict absenteeism at Company X during work time. The project is broken up into 3 phases:

* Phase 1: [Data Pre-processing and Exploratory Analysis](https://vanessamiranda.github.io/_pages/2019-08-21-Predicting_Absenteeism_Productivity.html)

* Phase 2: Predictive Modeling

 * Phase 3: [Visualizing Predictive Models](https://vanessamiranda.github.io/dataviz/) or [click here]() to view the interactive version
